## Run the application

For Android:

- open Android Studio, go to more actions, click on Virtual Device Manager, choose Pixel 3a (click on `create device` if
  it not in the list yet) and press "a" (for Android)
  &rarr; this will automatically display your app when you run it from IntelliJ

## Troubleshooting

- press "r" to reload
- delete caches and `node_modules` and reinstall everything for a clean start
- if the loading spinner is always shown or freezes, it makes sense to wipe the data from the Device Manager and restart
  the simulator completely again which also install expo go again
